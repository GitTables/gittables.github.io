Motivated by the many research challenges around CSV parsing, etc. we are excited to share that we released the 1M+ CSV files (+/-7GMB) associated with the GitTables 1M corpus.

The CSV files can be downloaded [**here**](https://zenodo.org/record/6515973).

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions/suggestions around the CSV files, or want to share your insights and use-cases!

Happy CSV'ing!
