We have published the corpus used for the analysis in the paper _GitTables: A Large-Scale Corpus of Relational Tables_.
This corpus consists of 1.7M tables from GitTables, which we refer to as the (**GitTables 1.7M**) corpus.

The corpus of roughly 25.5 GB is hosted on Zenodo, with DOI **10.5281/zenodo.4943312** and can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/record/4943312#.YMcUlzYzZ4I){:target="_blank"}.
