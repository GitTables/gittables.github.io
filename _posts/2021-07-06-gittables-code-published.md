We have published the code used for extracting CSV files from GitHub, parsing them to tables and annotating these tables with the DBpedia and Schema.org ontologies. It can be found in a GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/madelonhulsebos/gittables){:target="_blank"}.

Notebooks with code for reading the tables and column annotations from the Parquet files will be published soon as well!
