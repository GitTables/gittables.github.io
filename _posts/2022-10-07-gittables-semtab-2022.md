GitTables is featured in the SemTab challenge at ISWC 2023 again. This year, we host a much larger set of tables to facilitate machine learning approaches for table-to-KG matching as well.

We are pleased to see that the SemTab participants made impressive improvements compared to last year's results. This is a good indicator that systems are closing the performance gap on tables that typically cannot be matched to KGs easily.
